# IIoT-based big data-driven product lifecycle analysis and management 

## Project Scope
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The aim of this project is to design a platform that provides industrial producers with a production sustainability analysis. In this user interface, users enter information about their industrial production activities, and we use the Ecoinvent database to help them calculate their carbon emissions and provide hotspot recommendations. Whatâ€™s more, our carbon emissions can cover the entire supply chain of a product. 

The detailed introduction and design process can be found in the document: [Front End Design.docx](https://github.com/xuye0803/IIoT-based-product-LCA/files/10357355/Front.End.Design.docx)
